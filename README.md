<h1 align="center">Approaching a Data Science Workshop</h1>

<p align="center"><b><i>Created by <a href="github.com/amitparikh1" >@amitparikh1 </a> for Carolina Analytics and Data Science on 9/27/2023</b></i></p>

 This workshop is in preparation for CDC (Carolina Data Challenge 2023). It overviews the data science process and how you can go about approaching a data science project from scratch. To follow along, please see the slides in this repository. 

CDC is UNC’s weekend-long data science hackathon hosted by Carolina Analytics and Data Science (CADS) in partnership with the UNC Department of Computer Science.

Hosted at UNC Computer Science’s Sitterson Hall, participants will be able to work on an interesting data science project in teams, interact with our sponsors at the sponsorship fair, attend workshops to learn new data science skills, eat free food, earn prizes, and meet new friends also interested in data science!

CDC is completely beginner-friendly, with numerous workshops and networking opportunities for those completely new to data science. Whether you are a freshman, senior, or graduate student, there is something great for you at CDC.
